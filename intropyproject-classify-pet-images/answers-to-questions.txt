Project Results of 40 Image Classification:

Conclusion 1:  VGG and Alexnet correctly classify dogs and non-dog images 100 percent
of the time.

Conclusion 2:  VGG is the most accurate with dog breeds classified correctly more
than 90 percent of the time.

Conclusion 3:  However, considering the time resources of both models, ResNet and VGG,
ResNet is 10 times faster than VGG and almost as accurate in classifying dogs, non-dogs,
and dog breeds; therefore, ResNet is a good enough CNN model for image classification.


Results of Uploaded Image Classification:

1.  All three CNN models correctly classified the breed of dog.

2.  All three models correctly classified both un-flipped and flipped dog
pictures correctly.

3.  All three models correctly classified both non-dog images as not a dog.

4.  The model AlexNet exhibited the fastest and greatest accuracy when run on the
uploaded images when compared to the other two models because it was the only model
to correctly classify the type of inanimate object from an uploaded image of a chair.
